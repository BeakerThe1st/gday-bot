# G'day
G'day is a Discord moderation bot with a simple design philosophy: to supplement Discord's native moderation tools

be adapted and used successfully in any server.

- A communal "scratchpad" attached to each user for moderators to keep notes about particular users
- Additional supplemental moderation commands such as `/clear` and `/warn`
- A modmail system
- A ban appeal system from a corresponding web frontend
- "Event mode" for big server events with high traffic to answer FAQ throughout
- The G'bye network to share information about bans amongst various high profile tech servers.
- Full logging of join/leave, message edits & deletion, roles, nicknames, and case generation
- A tag system for responses to frequently asked questions in a support context
- Various other small, but nevertheless handy, features for the functioning of the r/Apple Discord

Please note that you will most likely want to adapt parts of the bot before using it in your own community, in particular,

very little utility outside of their designated purpose.
